    ## About
     A comprehensive Bolt API reference for interacting with Transactions, Orders, Product Catalog, Configuration, Testing, and much more.

     Note: You must also reference the [Merchant Callback API](/api-merchant) when building a managed checkout custom cart integration
tags:
  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      Set up webhooks to notify your backend of events within Bolt. These webhooks can communicate with your OMS or other systems to keep them up to date with Bolt. See our related guide on [Webhooks](https://help.bolt.com/get-started/during-checkout/webhooks/).
  - name: Testing
    description: |
      The testing endpoint allows you to test various functionality within Bolt. Create a test credit card to process a test payment in your store. You can also simulate tracking an order’s shipment and programmatically create customer accounts to use as dummy data. See our related guide on [Testing](https://help.bolt.com/developers/production-readiness-guides/test-cards/).
  - name: Products
    description: |
      Products within Bolt represent the products on your ecommerce server or store. Use this resource to create products and retrieve the Bolt product catalog. You can also create a store using this resource.
  - name: OAuth
    description: |
      Use this endpoint to retrieve an OAuth token. Use the token to allow your ecommerce server to make calls to the Account endpoint and create a one-click checkout experience for shoppers. See related guide [Fetch OAuth Token](https://help.bolt.com/products/accounts/direct-api/oauth-guide/).
  - name: Account
    description: |
      Use the Account endpoint to view and manage customer accounts. Perform actions such as creating an account, updating an address, or adding a payment method. This endpoint is for merchants using the Accounts Package. See our related guide on [Bolt OAuth](https://help.bolt.com/developers/bolt-oauth/).
  - name: Payments
    description: |
      Use the Payments API to tokenize and process alternative payment methods with Bolt. This API is for the Bolt Accounts package. See our related guide on [PayPal for Accounts Implementation](https://help.bolt.com/products/accounts/direct-api/paypal-embedded/).
  - name: Configuration
    description: |
      Use this resource to retrieve and set Merchant Callback URLs. Bolt uses these URLs to exchange information with your commerce server. See our related guide [About the Merchant Callback API](https://help.bolt.com/products/checkout/custom-cart-guides/how-to-integrate/merchant-api/).   
  - name: Orders
    description: |
      Use the Orders API to interact with the customer's cart throughout the checkout process. Pre-checkout, perform actions such as validating inventory, verifying discounts, and calculating taxes. Post-checkout, share shipping information so your customer can track their order. You'll interact with the [Merchant API](https://help.bolt.com/api-merchant/) to keep the servers in sync with any changes the customer makes to their cart. See our related guide [Create a Bolt Order Token](https://help.bolt.com/products/checkout/custom-cart-guides/how-to-integrate/create-bolt-order-token/).
  - name: Statements
    description: |
      [Statements](/merchants/references/financials/statements/) are available in the Merchant Dashboard for merchants who use Bolt Payments as their processor. Merchants using other processors do not receive these statements.
  - name: Transactions
    description: |
      Use the Transactions endpoint to authorize payments when the shopper checks out and handle post authorization actions such as captures and refunds. You can use a shopper's existing saved payment information or tokenize new payment information with the [Bolt Tokenizer](https://help.bolt.com/api-tokenizer/). Bolt Authorize Transaction types fall into one of three categories: a logged-in shopper checking out with a saved payment method, any type of shopper checking out with a new payment method, and a logged-in shopper checking out with a new payment method. The new payment method will be saved to the shopper's account.

        **Note**: Before using this API, the credit card details must be tokenized using Bolt's JavaScript library function, which is documented in [Install the Bolt Tokenizer](https://help.bolt.com/developers/references/bolt-tokenizer).

        Endpoint for receiving access, ID, and refresh tokens from Bolt's OAuth server. 

        To use this endpoint, first use the Authorization Code Request flow by using the `authorization_code` Grant Type (`grant_type`). Then, in the event that you would need a second or subsequent code, use the `refresh_token` value returned from a successful request as the `refresh_token` input value in your subsequent `refresh_token` Grant Type (`grant_type`) request.
