## Overview

In this first step, you'll set up a complete local development environment that mirrors production cloud-native infrastructure. This foundation will enable you to develop, test, and debug applications locally before deploying to production.

## Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop provides an easy way to run containers on your local machine and includes Kubernetes support.

### For macOS:

```bash
# Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
# Or install via Homebrew
brew install --cask docker
```

### For Windows:

1. Download Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Restart your computer when prompted

### For Linux:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add the repository
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## Step 2: Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Kubernetes**
3. Check **Enable Kubernetes**
4. Click **Apply & Restart**

Wait for Kubernetes to start (this may take several minutes).

## Step 3: Verify Your Installation

Run these commands to verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Kubernetes version
kubectl version --client

# Test Docker with a simple container
docker run hello-world

# Check Kubernetes cluster status
kubectl cluster-info
```

## Step 4: Install Additional Development Tools

### kubectl (if not included with Docker Desktop)

```bash
# macOS
brew install kubectl

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install kubernetes-cli

# Linux
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

### Helm Package Manager

```bash
# macOS
brew install helm

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install kubernetes-helm

# Linux
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install helm
```

### k9s (Optional but Recommended)

k9s provides a terminal-based UI for managing Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
# macOS
brew install k9s

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install k9s

# Linux
curl -sS https://webinstall.dev/k9s | bash
```

## Step 5: Configure Your Development Environment

Create a dedicated namespace for development:

```bash
kubectl create namespace dev-environment
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev-environment
```

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to the next step, ensure you can run these commands successfully:

- [ ] `docker run hello-world` completes without errors
- [ ] `kubectl get nodes` shows your local cluster
- [ ] `helm version` displays the installed version
- [ ] `kubectl get namespaces` shows your `dev-environment` namespace

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Docker not starting:**
- Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements
- Check that virtualization is enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Try restarting Docker Desktop

**Kubernetes not starting:**
- Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation to at least 4GB
- Reset Kubernetes cluster in Docker Desktop settings
- Check Docker Desktop logs for specific error messages

**Permission denied errors (Linux):**
```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```

## What's Next?

With your development environment set up, you're ready to build and containerize your first application. In the next step, you'll create a sample web application, write a Dockerfile, and build your first container image.

The foundation you've built here will support all future development work, so take time to ensure everything is working properly before proceeding.
