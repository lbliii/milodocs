<!--start -->
Inline code samples are great --- but code samples that are pulled from source files can be even better! This `{{%/*include*/%}}` shortcode is inspired by Sphinx's `.. literalinclude::` functionality.

This document is going to be a bit meta.

## How it works

The `{{%/*include*/%}}` shortcode accepts 3 **positional** args: `lang`, `start`, and `stop`. All are optional.

{{<notice warning "Don't forget to use %">}}
This shortcode relies on Hugo's markdown rendering to automatically handle code syntax highlighting. If you surround this shortcode with `<` `>` instead, it will break.
